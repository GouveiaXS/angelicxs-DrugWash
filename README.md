This drug wash script is an dual function script. You can use the features at the same time or use either one separately.
Function one: Bulk Drug Sales
This feature allows you to enable certain gangs/jobs to have a specific NPC dealer who will purchase their illegal items directly and provide them money (can be an item or account).
You are able to make rank specific NPCs for that gang/job who can provide different rates depending on the accessing rank.
Function one: Money Wash
This feature is a method for players to turn their dirty money into clean money. This is done by providing them a random mission to save the money wash NPC who upon reaching will exchange all their current illicit funds for clean money.
Can customize as many missions as desired, adding more defensive NPCs and change the ratio at which the money is exchanged from. Players will only be able to exchange funds once per mission.

***NOTE*** This script does not support meta data value for items; when using dirty money as an item each 'dirty money item' must have a value of 1.
